# Getting Started With X (formerly "Twitter") 


## Overview
Hello, and welcome!

On this page, you will find simple steps that will guide you towards creating your first X account as well as how to maneuver your account.

 X is an online social media and social networking tool where users can post texts (called "tweets"), images, videos, animated GIFs, and polls. In addition, users can like, comment on, repost, and/or quote others' posts. That is not all, users can also send direct messages (DMs) to other registered users.

Asides from its networking features, companies also leverage on X to build visibility, grow their brand, and reach both new and existing customers. As such, it works well for both individuals who are looking to connect with others and have fun, and businesses who are in need of social media representation.

In the following steps, I will be showing you how to get started on X:

1. Create your account
2. Upload a profile picture
3. Write your bio
4. Follow other users 
5. Share contents
6. Common X terminologies and their meaning






## 1. Create your account
The first step in getting started on X is to create an account, and this is as simple as giving some basic information and selecting a username (commonly known as "handle"), in addition to your display name. This username is the ID that other users will use to find you on X. It is a crucial component of your online identity so you should make it unique. I recommend keeping it short so that it is memorable and does not consume too many characters. 
Feel free to use capital letters, but people can find you using lowercase letters as well. If your preferred username is taken, suggestions may be given for closer substitues.

To create an account, either go to www.twitter.com on your web browser if you're using a computer, or you download the X app if you're using a mobile device.
## 2. Upload a profile picture
Like your username, it's great to add a profile picture when creating your account. This makes it easier for people to recognize you on Twitter and is the first thing they see when they visit your account. You can also add a header image to give your profile a more distinct look. If you choose to skip this step during the signup process, you can always add it later. 
## 3. Write your bio
When people visit your X profile, one of the first things they notice is your bio. This is the section of your profile where you tell a little bit about yourself. It should include some basic information about you as well as any vital information you want visitors to know when they visit your page. In the "Location" area, you may include your location. When you are done, you may fill in your birthday.
## 4. Follow other users
X is near useless if you are not communicating with others, so spend some time following other individuals who may be in your field. Once you sign up, X will bring suggestions of accounts you can follow based on the interest(s) you have chosen. The list may include celebrities, politicians, journalists, artisis, etc. In addition to the suggestions, you can also search for the names of people and brands you'd like to follow. Following and communicating with other users is a great strategy to raise your visibility.
In order to be followed, you must first follow.




## 5. Make a post
The post you choose to make can be anything - a link, an image, a video, a GIF, a poll, or even an emoji - but  the goal should be to encourage people to read, respond to, and share it. The more individuals who see your post and share it on their own timelines, the faster it spreads and reaches a wider audience.

In a single post, you have 280 characters (including spaces). A counter on the bottom right of the post box indicates how much space you have left. Remember, you can establish a thread with many posts to pass across a longer message.


## Common X Terminologies And Their Meaning
- Handle: your unique username that people find your account with. It starts with an "@".
- Hashtag: this starts with the "#" sign and is used to get into the happenings on X. When you click on it, it takes you to associated tweets; some accounts also use it for visibility.
- Like: People "like" (i.e. click on the small heart-shaped icon below every tweet) a tweet that they like, agree with, or support. The number of likes can be found beside the icon.
- Retweet (now repost): this function is used to share valuable posts on your timeline without adding your opinion.
- Quote tweet: this is used to add your opinion when reposting others' posts.
- Mention: When others type the "@" sign with your username in a post, they have mentioned you and you get notified.
- Thread: this is a group of connected posts, used to give additional information about the same post.
- Direct messages: this is to send messages privately to other users.
- X spaces: this function enables live audio discussions.
## Conclusion
As you have seen, X is a great networking tool with lots of benefits if utilized properly.

I hope you find this guide useful.
